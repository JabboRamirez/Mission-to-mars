Module 10


## Overview

Performing a web scraping from Nasa’s websites in order to retrieve information about Nasa’s latest article. All retrieved data is put together in a single web application to showcase the gathered information.

For this project I am using:

Chrome Developer Tool to identify HTML and CSS components.
Beautiful Soup and Splinter to automate the scrape jupyter notebook.
Python to write the script scraping.py.
MongoDB, a NoSQL database to store data. MongoDB can handle the data that isn’t structured, data without relationships to other data. Mongo uses a document model which means that data is stored in JSON data structures.
Flask to render the data and create a web application app.py.
HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 3 to customize web application index.html.
